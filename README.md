## Game Mechanics Questions

_Pulled from meeting notes_

> What are the max values for CO2 and Money?

> Maximum card numbers (action + events)

> Do you place cards on bottom of deck?

> What happens to discarded cards?

> What happens if the player runs out of action cards?

> What happens if the player runs out of event cards?

> Why do we have smile and frown in the card list?

> Will need to create separate list for cards

> What does paying money do in the singleplayer version for hope cards?

> You have to play a card with any kind of hope value when a negative hope card is played?

> The only other option if you have to hope based cards is to skip?

> Momentum on hope cards? How does it work? If a player already met the hope requirement then they shouldnâ€™t matter if the card has hope after it?

> When hope reaches negative 3 should the player lose at the start of the turn or end of it?
- Can lose before turn starts
- Money loses at start
- Co2 above 30 start
- Run out of event cards check at end of turn

> If an event gives momentum, then can the player still play three cards?

Does not matter, can only play two cards

> Can the player skip their turn?

Want that feature, only during hope breaker
Bad hope only applies to current turn

> What if they run out of action cards?

No concrete answer given

> If hope is below is still negative after first hope card is played does momentum matter?

Break the initial hope problem
